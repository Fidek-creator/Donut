This is my first 3D model I have ever made!

## About
This section is for who is interested in my person. :blush: </br>
The motivation behind the creation of this 3D model is rooted in my passion for creating things since childhood. From building with Lego blocks to assembling models with glue, I have always had a fascination for the process of creation. As someone who is also interested in computer technology, I decided to explore the world of 3D modeling using Blender.
I believe that 3D modelling is an exciting and innovative way to bring ideas to life, even if you got lack of sense of artistry.

## Special thanks :v:
